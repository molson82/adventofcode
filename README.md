# Advent of Code

Here lies my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), an Advent calendar full of programming puzzles from December 1st all the way to Christmas.

Previous years are also saved in their respective folders.

## Implementation Goals

The solutions posted here are NOT cleaned-up versions and I will not be aiming for the leaderboards. For all solutions, the main implementation goals were, in descending order:

- **Readability:** Clean, readable, self-explanatory and commented code above all else.
- **Input Generalization:** Should work not only for my input but for anyone's, with some assumptions made about it, which are noted when appropriate.
- **Minimal Imports:** Refrain from `import`s besides utilities (`strings`, `time`, `fmt`) and basic standard libraries (`math`, `itertools`, `collections`). When the knowledge of functions and structures are considered vital to the problem solution (graphs, trees, linked lists, union-find, etc.), reimplement them.
